# Smart Contracts with Java
This repo contains a sample code showing how to create an account, deploy a smart contract, call it and listen to its transactions using Java.

For didactic purposes it was writen using structured programming, instead of objected oriented. So, don't reuse this code. When implementing a real app, I suggest using the [web3j](https://github.com/web3j/web3j) generators and their patterns.

### Get started

To get started:
1. Run _./gradlew eclipse_
2. Import the project using Eclipse.
3. Try to debug the main class _net.consensys.sample.App_ 
4. Play with it.

### Folders
- **contracts**: The smart contract, bytecode and ABI.
- **src/main/java**: The Java code with the main class as _net.consensys.sample.App_
